      <p> Brainy Smurf is well, the brainy one. He is always eager to show off his intelligence. He is also known for
        his tendency to boss others around, and for being a bit of a know-it-all, but deep down he cares for his friends
        and wants the best for them.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="Cont chid-div2"> <img class="pic2" src="Clumsy.jpg">
      <p> Clumsy is understanding and optimistic. He is clueless, and a little slow, but overall good-hearted and
        sweet-tempered. He cherishes his friends. He tends to go along with what other smurfs are doing, and loves to
        help out, despite his awkwardness.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="Cont chid-div3">
      <p> Smurfette is smart, capable, and energetic with a 'can-do-attitude'. She loves herself and (most) everyone
        around her, leading her to be involved in almost everything that goes on. She is very caring, soft and humble to
        everyone except Clumsy.</p> <img class="pic3" src="Smurfette.jpg">
    </div>
    <div class="Cont chid-div4"> <img class="pic4" src="Grouchy.jpg">
      <p> Grouchy Smurf is the grumpiest of the Smurfs, but he's also the one who will always have your back. He is
        known for his stubbornness and grouchiness, but also for his loyalty and dependability. He will complain, but
        will always be there when you need him.</p>
